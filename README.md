# Hey it's me!!

- ğŸ‘‹ I am a college student, a statistics major in the school of engineering - how does that sound?
- ğŸ‘€ I'm interesting in statistics and building wheels. Probably I should get them on to GitHub so others can see my crappy - but hopefully rolling - wheels.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ML! The public project will be to build elements of sklearn. I've already decided that it should be called rklearn. What a great name!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ... in case you ever need to? it's rockzhangenyan on gmail.
